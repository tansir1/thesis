The goal of this research was to develop a decentralized algorithm for controlling multiple heterogeneous Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) in ``search and act'' scenarios.  The research seeks a solution that simultaneously solves the classic Weapon Target Assignment\todo{False} problem while controlling a distributed swarm of agents.  The solution requires balancing the optimization of tasks currently known to the swarm while encouraging spatial exploration to find new tasks within the environment.  In this work a swarm of UAVs was simulated and given a mission to find and destroy all targets in an unknown area.
