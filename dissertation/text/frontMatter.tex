The goal of this research was to develop a decentralized algorithm for controlling multiple heterogeneous Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) in ``search and act'' scenarios without the need for two-way communication protocols.  This allows the swarm to act in communication poor environments.  The solution requires balancing the optimization of tasks currently known to the swarm while encouraging spatial exploration to find new tasks within the environment.  In this work a swarm of UAVs was simulated and given a mission to find and destroy all targets in an unknown area.
