\section*{Acknowledgments}
Many people helped contribute to make this work a reality and I cannot possibly thank them all.  Thank you to the faculty for taking a risk on this new school.  Thank you to John Sauter, my advisor, for always providing useful feedback and sticking with me much longer than originally planned.  Thank you to all the scholars who came before me to help illuminate the unknown.

\section*{Dedication}
To my wife whose monumental support and encouragement made this crazy dream possible [Achievement Unlocked!].
\\ \\
To my parents who did everything they could to encourage my unending torrents of ``how does that work'' despite their sanity.  ``Where does electricity come from?''
\\ \\
To my son without whom I would have graduated years earlier.  ``No working!''
