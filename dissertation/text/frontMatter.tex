The goal of this research was to develop a decentralized algorithm for controlling multiple heterogeneous unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) in search-and-act scenarios.  The research seeks a solution that simultaneously solves the classic Weapon Target Assignment problem while controlling a distributed swarm of agents.  The solution requires balancing the optimization of tasks currently known to the swarm while encouraging spatial exploration to find new tasks within the environment.
