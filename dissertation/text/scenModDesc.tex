A custom simulation program was created in order to develop and test a new type of decentralized swarm control algorithm. The simulation is meant to be an approximation of the physical world therefore it contains models for UAVs, UAV payloads, moving targets, fixed targets, and target safe havens.  These models are described in sections~\ref{sec:target_model} - \ref{sec:sensor_wpn_models}.  Section~\ref{sec:myModel} describes a new UAV swarm control algorithm to satisfy the goals of the research.  This algorithm is used to direct the simulated UAV swarm to seek and destroy all of the targets in the simulated worlds.

The simulated worlds are randomly generated via a custom utility for the project.  The number of UAVs, targets, and havens are configurable.  The worlds are rectangular and their sizes are configurable.  The utility reads the configuration file and generates data files describing random worlds.  

%  See ~\ref{sec:exampleWorldCfg} for an example configuration file.

The direction of travel for moving targets is constrained to a randomly generated road network within the world.  ``Target safe havens'' are locations in the world where a target may flee to and be safe from UAV attack and surveillance.  These havens are randomly located within the world on the road network.  Moving targets will travel from one haven to the next.

An example rendering of a random world is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sample_world}. Static targets are shown as red buildings.  Mobile targets are red triangles along the road.  Blue triangles are UAVs.  The yellow boxes are havens for the mobile targets.
