\section{Suggestions for Future Work}
Targets that sense they are under surveillance or attack, and evade in response.

False targets/non-combatants.

UAVs with comm-relay payloads?

Intelligently choose a search algorithm instead of random.


Enable attack and monitor from same platform.

Sensor type expertise should weigh into cell and target belief merging


"Interested" agent bidding - those stuck doing another task at the moment but might want to switch or queue up if their bid is extremely good
