\chapter{Introduction}
A common task for teams of agents is to ``search and act.''  The team members must search an area for a target object and then perform an action once the objective is found.  This commonly referred to as search-and-rescue and search-and-destroy.

Controlling UAVs today requires multiple people per vehicle.  Particularly in military situations thereâ€™s usually a pilot and a payload operator that work together to manipulate the aircraft.  There is little to no direct data sharing between multiple UAVs and their crews which creates significant inefficiencies when trying to cooperate and perform missions together.  These inefficiencies are compounded in unstructured missions that require multiple aircraft to search an area together.  \colorbox{yellow}{Buzz word bingo} The research presented here created a distributed control algorithm that coordinates the actions of heterogeneous UAV platforms that can cooperate effectively while searching and engaging targets efficiently with limited communication abilities.

\textit{The physical manifestation of this algorithm will allow for a drastic reduction in human resources required to operate a swarm of UAVs.}

\textit{The research presented here created a simulation to model a team of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) performing a search-and-destroy style mission.  }
