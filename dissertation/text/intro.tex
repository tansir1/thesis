\chapter{Introduction}
A common task for teams of agents is to ``search and act.''  The team members must search an area for a target object and then perform an action once the objective is found.  This commonly referred to as ``search and rescue'' and ``search and destroy.'' Both of these types of missions are commonly carried out by military forces but they are done problematic to perform efficiently.

Controlling military UAVs typically requires multiple people per vehicle.  Thereâ€™s usually a pilot and a payload operator that work together to manipulate the aircraft.  There is little to no direct data sharing between multiple UAVs and their crews which creates significant inefficiencies when trying to cooperate and perform missions together.  These inefficiencies are compounded in unstructured missions that require multiple aircraft to search an area together for unknown targets.  The research presented here created a distributed control algorithm that coordinates the actions of heterogeneous UAV platforms with limited communication abilities so they can cooperate effectively while searching and engaging targets.
