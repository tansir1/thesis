\chapter{Target Model}
There are static targets and moving targets.  Static targets have a fixed position and orientation like a building.  Moving targets, as their name implies, have a dynamic position and orientation.  They move through the road network from haven to haven with a fixed velocity similar to an automobile in a city.  Targets have two notable attributes; \textit{Best Angle} and \textit{Max Speed}.

The Max Speed of a static target is zero and a moving target has a non-zero positive value.  The Best Angle of a target is the best angle for sensing and attacking the target.  The Best Angle is used in computing the performance or chance of success of a weapon or sensor accomplishing its task against the target.  If the relative angle between the weapon or sensor and the target deviates from the Best Angle then the weapon or sensor will suffer a performance degradation.  

%Figures \textbf{XXX, YYY, ZZZ, and WWW} show examples of good and poor alignment between a target and the UAVs. \textbf{TODO: CREATE GOOD AND BAD ANGLE DIAGRAMS}

Moving targets cannot sense or actively evade UAVs.  They travel from haven to haven where they cannot be monitored or attacked by a UAV.  Once they arrive at a haven they will stay for a random but limited amount of time before moving to a new haven.  This behavior is designed to mimic a target hiding, performing deliveries, or having meetings at various locations.  The order of haven visitation is random.  Moving targets generate a path along the road network from haven to haven using the classic A* algorithm described in~\cite{wiki:astar}.
